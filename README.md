## Project Description

The goal of this project is to build a job application tracker full stack application. In the backend an API is built using Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, and Mongoose. The API has two models and one association. There is Create, Read, Update, and Destroy (CRUD) functionality built throughout the application. In the frontend JavaScript and jQuery are used to communicate with and leverage the backend API. The fronend also has a responsive design for mobile, tablet, and desktops. The mobile navigation is responsive such that it expands and collapses when a user clicks on the hamburger icon.

## Time/Priority Matrix 

Here is a full list of features that have been [prioritized](https://res.cloudinary.com/dssciwyew/image/upload/v1596211407/Time%20Matrix%20P2.png) based on the `Time and Priority` Matix.
